In easy words, you also attain oral addiction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, when you will not smoke for some time, your mouth will crave for something to have in it. You might fill this craving with chewing gum, appetizers, nuts, carrots, raw vegetables, etc. Anything you would like to chew.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5. Remove all reminders<br>You must keep your environment smoking free, you should remove all smoking remainders you might have in your bedroom, home, office or car. Like, ashtray, cigarette buds, smoke, smoking posters, lighters, and matches, etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cigarette smoke is also a trigger to smoking, so also avoid it as much as possible.
